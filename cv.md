### Profile
Proactive and human-centered graduate-to-be of Charles University with excellent communication skills, proficiency in several languages and multinational background. Outstanding knowledge of multiple cultures and psychology with a strong belief in the need to understand the human experience helps to easily find an approach to anyone. Well-developed emotional intelligence helps to quickly get involved in working with a team and to communicate within it. 

### Background
When I was a child, my family moved to Montenegro, where I spent my youth and graduated from high school. I traveled by car all the Balkans and several countries of Central Europe, gaining my **first experience in communicating with people from different cultures**. Then, I decided to continue my studies at a Charles University in the Czech Republic. I wanted my idea of the country in which I lived half of my life to be complete, so I chose Balkan studies at the **Faculty of Arts**, with major in **Serbian language, literature and history**. Since then and to this day I never cease to be amazed at the diversity of the people and cultures around me, I am happy to know and get closer to them. Here, in Prague, in addition to new life and people, I found a new hobby, **User Experience Design**, in which I am trying to improve and lead several projects. Thanks to this hobby, I have a new look at my main job, **Human Resources**, and now I take into account a lot more things during the recruitment process. Now I am actively involved in learning a new skill for myself - **coding**. I enrolled in courses from the **The Rolling Scopes School** and enjoying my new studies.
